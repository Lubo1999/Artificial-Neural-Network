# Artificial-Neural-Network
ANN implementation in C# using WinForms - Synthesis and analysis of algorithms course work.

You can build your own neural network(set up the hidden layers as well as the activation function on each layer) using the simple interface and as well train it on the famous MNIST fashion dataset. While the nn is being trained you can see how the loss function progresses.
The training is done using mini-batch gradient descent.
